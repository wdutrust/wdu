Contract Verification & Ownership Clarification



1. Purpose of This Contract Verification Page – BscScan Compliance Focus

This page delivers a precise, non-promotional, technically accurate overview of the WDU Trust Token (WDU) smart contract to satisfy blockchain explorer standards, particularly BscScan requirements for:

Clear, detailed explanation of contract behavior and mechanics, including BEP-20 functions like transfer, balanceOf, approve, allowance, totalSupply, with no custom additions.
Explicit scope and limitations of ownership/control, ensuring no hidden powers or modifications possible.
Identification of responsible human parties with accountability, including non-anonymous founder and team with verifiable public professional profiles.
Absolute confirmation of immutability, no hidden functions, and no future manipulation risk, all enforceable on-chain.
Clear project information on the token's educational purpose, fixed supply, and independence from any financial or external entities.
**No** content here is an investment claim, financial promise, security guarantee, or value assurance. All information derives directly from the **publicly verified smart contract source code** and observable on-chain behavior, with no misrepresentation or distortion from public institutions, other projects, or entities. This page provides exhaustive, verifiable details to address any concerns about project clarity.

2. Technical Contract Summary – Immutable Parameters & BEP-20 Compliance
The WDU Trust Token (WDU) is a standard BEP-20 token on BNB Smart Chain, fully compliant with the BEP-20 specification. This means it implements all required functions without deviations: totalSupply() returns the fixed supply, balanceOf() queries balances, transfer() moves tokens, transferFrom() allows delegated transfers, approve() sets allowances, and allowance() checks permissions. Events (Transfer, Approval) are emitted as per the standard, ensuring compatibility with wallets and DEXs.

Blockchain: BNB Smart Chain (BSC) – Chosen for its public, decentralized ledger.
Token Standard: BEP-20 (fully compliant, no custom extensions) – Adheres to BNB Chain's guidelines for token interfaces.
Contract Status: Fully source-code verified on BscScan – Code matches deployed bytecode exactly.
Verification Date: December 18, 2025 – BscScan confirmation of authenticity.
Upgradeable / Proxy Pattern: Not used – Contract is final and non-replaceable, with no UUPS or proxy logic to prevent changes.
Mint Function: Not implemented – Impossible to create new tokens, as no mint() exists in the code.
Burn Function: Not implemented – No programmatic supply reduction, preserving the fixed total.
Transaction Fees / Taxes: 0% – No deductions, reflections, or redistributions; transfers are pure.
Blacklist / Pause / Freeze: Not implemented – No restrictions on users or transfers; fully open and neutral.
Total Supply: Exactly 700,000,000,000,000 (700 trillion) – Minted once in constructor, verifiable via totalSupply().
Decimals: 18 – Standard divisibility for precision, common in BEP-20 tokens.
This simple design educates on minimal, secure BEP-20 implementation. No custom logic means no hidden risks – all behavior is standard and predictable.

3. Contract Address & Direct Verification Links – On-Chain Proof
All claims are verifiable directly on BscScan – the ultimate source of truth. We've expanded with step-by-step instructions:

Contract Address: 0x74D7d1aD19bD14655cD0Ab26BEcc57ED69d69413

Verification Steps (Simple & Independent):

Visit BscScan link above > Click "Contract" tab > Review verified source code – Matches standard BEP-20 template exactly.
Click "Read Contract" > Call totalSupply() – Confirms fixed 700 trillion (with 18 decimals).
Call owner() – Shows deployer wallet; no special privileges in code.
Search code for "mint", "burn", "pause" – None exist, proving immutability.
Review deployment transaction – Single mint event with full supply.
This on-chain focus ensures no off-chain discrepancies, aligning with BscScan's verification ethos.

4. Mechanics & Behavior – Standard BEP-20 Only, No Additions
The contract implements **only** the required BEP-20 interface functions, with no extras. Transfers move exact amounts without fees; approvals enable safe delegations; balances are queried transparently.

Transfers: Standard transfer() and transferFrom() – No taxes, no events beyond Transfer.
Approvals: approve() and allowance() – Basic delegation, no overrides.
Supply Queries: totalSupply() and balanceOf() – Always accurate, no caching or modifications.
Events: Transfer and Approval emitted precisely as per BEP-20 spec.
**No** reflections, auto-burns, rewards, or economic hooks – pure educational standard. Verify by simulating in Remix IDE with verified source.

6. Immutability, Transparency & Encouragement for Independent Verification
No upgradeable proxy, external calls, or replaceable logic — execution paths are fully visible in verified source code. The contract's behavior is fixed forever, with no way to alter it post-deployment.

Anyone (developers, auditors, reviewers) can independently:

Read verified code on BscScan – inspect for BEP-20 functions and absences.
Simulate transfers/balances – use "Write Contract" to test behavior.
Confirm no hidden functions – search code for mint, burn, etc., and find none.
Compile and deploy locally – verify identical behavior in testnets.
Verified Contract Address:
0x74D7d1aD19bD14655cD0Ab26BEcc57ED69d69413

**Rely on on-chain data and verified code** — not off-chain summaries. This guarantees identical behavior forever, addressing clarity and verifiability.

7. Non-Misrepresentation & Independence Assurance
All descriptions are original, truthful, and specific to this project – no copying or distortion from public entities, other tokens, or projects. WDU Trust is fully independent, with **no affiliation** to Binance, BNB Chain, or any organization. No false claims or misleading similarities exist.
