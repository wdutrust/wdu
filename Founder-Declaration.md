Founder Declaration, Identity & Legal Responsibility
Official Statement by woodi usimo – Maximum Transparency & Accountability for BscScan Review

1. Formal Founder Declaration & Identity Confirmation
I, woodi usimo, as the **founder, sole project owner, smart contract deployer, and primary responsible individual**, hereby formally and publicly declare that I am the **real, identifiable, and accountable person** behind the WDU Trust Token (WDU) project. This declaration is made to ensure complete transparency, providing a verifiable point of contact and eliminating any ambiguity about the project's origins and management.

The WDU Trust project is **not** operated by any anonymous group, decentralized organization (DAO), external company, shell entity, proxy operator, or undisclosed controlling party. **All responsibility** — technical, legal, transparency, and documentation — rests directly with me and the openly disclosed core team members. To further clarify, this structure promotes accountability while maintaining the project's educational focus, with all decisions traceable to named individuals.

This declaration is published **specifically** to remove every possible uncertainty, ambiguity, or doubt regarding authorship, ownership, control, and human accountability for blockchain explorers (especially BscScan), reviewers, and the public. It addresses verification standards by offering detailed, original information without any reliance on or distortion of external entities.

2. Founder Roles, Direct Responsibilities & Accountability
As the identified founder and owner, I accept **full, personal, and direct responsibility** for every aspect of the WDU Trust project, including but not limited to:

Design, writing, deployment, and public source code verification of the WDU smart contract on BNB Smart Chain (verified on BscScan December 18, 2025), ensuring it matches the BEP-20 standard exactly.
Ensuring complete immutability, absence of mint/burn/tax/pause/upgrade functions, and removal of any hidden or privileged controls, which promotes secure and predictable behavior for educational purposes.
Accuracy, truthfulness, consistency, and originality of all public documentation, website content, and disclosures, with regular checks for alignment with on-chain data.
Ownership, operation, and maintenance of the official website: https://www.wdu-trust.com, serving as a central hub for verifiable information.
Management, updates, and transparency of official GitHub repositories, allowing community audits.
Control, moderation, and factual accuracy of all official communication channels, focused on education.
Coordination with the openly identified core team members (listed below), ensuring collaborative transparency.
**No operational authority, contract control, decision-making power, or responsibility** is delegated to any anonymous person, third-party service, marketing agency, shell company, or undisclosed party. This ensures direct accountability, with all aspects traceable to named individuals.

As founder, I **do not** and **cannot**:

Control, alter, or interfere with on-chain token transfers or balances – the contract is immutable and decentralized
Mint new tokens or change the fixed supply – no mint function exists
Burn or destroy tokens – no burn function exists
Impose taxes, fees, or reflections on transactions – pure BEP-20 behavior
Pause, freeze, blacklist, or restrict any addresses – no such mechanisms
Upgrade or modify the deployed code – no proxy or upgradeable patterns
These technical limitations are **permanent and verifiable** in the public source code, emphasizing the project's commitment to decentralization and education.

3. Strong Non-Financial Declaration & Explicit Non-Investment Assurance
I, woodi usimo, explicitly and repeatedly declare that WDU Trust Token (WDU) is **strictly an educational and transparency demonstration project** with **zero financial, investment, or commercial intent**. It does **not** represent, imply, or function as any form of financial instrument, security, equity, share, dividend-bearing asset, profit-sharing mechanism, or investment opportunity in any jurisdiction.

The project has **never** and **will never** involve:

Any form of fundraising, ICO, IDO, presale, public sale, or capital raising – no economic activities
Staking, farming, yield, rewards, or incentive programs – no financial mechanisms
Any promise or implication of returns, profits, value appreciation, or economic benefits – educational only
Any connection to real-world assets, utilities, services, or commercial ecosystems – independent demo
Any marketing, promotion, hype, or calls to action for speculation – transparency focused
No financial outcomes are promised or implied. Token interaction is **voluntary and at the user's sole risk**. This declaration is repeated and expanded to prevent any misinterpretation, ensuring alignment with BscScan's non-financial emphasis.

4. Core Team Disclosure – Non-Anonymous with Public Professional Profiles
To fully comply with BscScan and explorer standards for team transparency, the core team consists of **two publicly identifiable individuals** with **multiple verifiable professional profiles** (standard in Web3 as equivalents to LinkedIn: X for visibility, Medium for articles, Instagram for outreach, Telegram for communication, Bitcointalk for discussions). This ensures no anonymity and allows independent checks of contributions.
