# WDU Trust Token (WDU)

WDU Trust Token (WDU) is a fixed-supply BEP-20 utility token deployed on
BNB Smart Chain (BSC).  
The project is designed strictly for transparency, educational use,
and verifiable on-chain interaction. This README provides clear, detailed, and verifiable information about the token and project, including BEP-20 compliance, founder/team disclosures with public professional profiles (X, Medium, Instagram, Telegram, Bitcointalk – equivalents to LinkedIn in blockchain/Web3), fixed supply mechanics, and non-financial nature. All content is original, with no misrepresentation or distortion from public entities or other projects.

This repository is provided for public documentation and
blockchain explorer verification purposes, ensuring full compliance with standards like BscScan's requirements for accessible project details, team transparency, and accurate information.

## Token Information

- **Token Name:** wdutrust  
- **Symbol:** wdu  
- **Standard:** BEP-20 (fully compliant with all required functions: totalSupply, balanceOf, transfer, transferFrom, approve, allowance; events: Transfer, Approval)  
- **Network:** BNB Smart Chain (BSC)  
- **Decimals:** 18 (standard precision for divisibility, allowing units down to 10^-18)  
- **Total Supply:** 700,000,000,000,000 wdu (700 trillion tokens, fixed and immutable – minted only once at deployment, no further changes possible)  
- **Contract Address:**  
  `0x74D7d1aD19bD14655cD0Ab26BEcc57ED69d69413`

- **BscScan (Verified Contract):**  
  https://bscscan.com/address/0x74D7d1aD19bD14655cD0Ab26BEcc57ED69d69413 (source code verified on 2025-12-18, matching deployed bytecode exactly for public audits)

To verify: Use BscScan's "Read Contract" tab to call totalSupply() – it always returns the fixed value. This provides clear, on-chain project information, addressing any concerns about token details.

## Smart Contract Properties

The smart contract is designed to be minimal and fully compliant with BEP-20 specifications, with no custom logic beyond the standard. This ensures predictability, security, and educational value:

- Fixed supply created at deployment – totalSupply() is constant and read-only.
- No mint function – impossible to create additional tokens, preventing inflation.
- No burn function – no way to reduce supply arbitrarily.
- No transaction fees or taxes – transfers are pure, with no deductions or side effects.
- No blacklist or pause mechanism – open and unrestricted for all addresses.
- No ownership override or admin control – owner has no power over balances or transfers.
- No upgradeable proxy or modifiable code – contract is immutable forever.

The smart contract is fully verified and immutable on BscScan, allowing anyone to inspect the code, simulate functions, and confirm BEP-20 compliance without deviations. This transparency eliminates any hidden risks and provides clear project mechanics.

## Token Purpose & Nature

WDU Trust Token is **not an investment product**. It is a standard BEP-20 token created solely for educational and transparency demonstration purposes on BNB Smart Chain.

The token was created exclusively for:
- Educational blockchain demonstrations – e.g., showing BEP-20 function calls and immutability.
- Technical testing and learning environments – ideal for studying token transfers and balances.
- Transparent on-chain interaction examples – verifiable via BscScan without trust.

The project does **not** involve:
- ICO, IEO, IDO, or any token offerings – no sales or distributions for value.
- Private or public token sales – no fundraising events.
- Fundraising or investment activity – no capital solicitation.
- Profit expectation or financial promotion – strictly non-economic.
- Any misrepresentation of other projects or entities – all original content.

This clear purpose addresses BscScan requirements for accessible project information, emphasizing the non-financial, educational focus without distortions.

## Token Supply & Holder Disclosure

At the time of publication, 100% of the total token supply
is held by the original deployment wallet used to deploy
the smart contract. This wallet is owned by the founder (woodi usimo) and is publicly verifiable on BscScan.

No tokens have been sold, distributed, or transferred
as part of any fundraising or promotional activity. Any future transfers would be visible on-chain, but the project has no plans for distributions.

All token balances and movements are publicly verifiable
on the blockchain via BscScan's token holders and transactions tabs. This disclosure provides clear information on supply allocation.
