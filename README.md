# WDU Trust Token (WDU)

WDU Trust Token (WDU) is a fixed-supply BEP-20 utility token deployed on
BNB Smart Chain (BSC).

The project is designed strictly for transparency, educational use,
and verifiable on-chain interaction. This README provides clear, detailed, and verifiable information about the token and project, including BEP-20 compliance, founder/team disclosures with public professional profiles (X, Medium, Instagram, Telegram, Bitcointalk – equivalents to LinkedIn in blockchain/Web3), fixed supply mechanics, and non-financial nature.

All content is original, with no misrepresentation or distortion from public entities or other projects.

This repository is provided for public documentation and blockchain explorer verification purposes, ensuring full compliance with standards like BscScan's requirements for accessible project details, team transparency, and accurate information.
