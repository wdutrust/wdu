Contact & Project Responsibility

Introduction & Purpose

This page provides a comprehensive overview of the official contact channels, project responsibility, and human accountability for the WDU Trust Token (WDU). It is designed to meet BscScan's requirements for clear information about the token and project, including transparent details on the founder and team members with supporting professional profiles (equivalents to LinkedIn, such as X, Medium, Instagram, Telegram, Bitcointalk for blockchain discussions and contributions). All information is factual, verifiable, and free from any misrepresentation of public entities or other projects. To elaborate, this document ensures that users and reviewers can easily access and verify all aspects of the project's identity, operations, and intent, addressing any potential concerns about clarity or disclosure.

The WDU Trust Token is a simple, educational BEP-20 token on the BNB Smart Chain, fully compliant with BEP-20 specifications. It features standard functions like transfer, balanceOf, and allowance, with no additional mechanisms such as minting, burning, taxes, or pauses. The project has no financial purpose, and no channel listed here is used for investment advice, price discussions, speculation, or financial activities. This ensures full transparency and prevents any potential misunderstanding. Furthermore, the token's details are on-chain verifiable, with a fixed supply and immutable code, providing a practical example for blockchain education.

Official Project Contact Channels
To ensure clear and verifiable communication, the following are the only official channels for the project. These are used exclusively for transparency, verification, and educational purposes, such as responding to BscScan inquiries or clarifying on-chain data. We've expanded this list with explanations for each channel to highlight their role in maintaining openness.

Primary Contact Email (Official & Verified): wdu@wdu-trust.com – This domain-based email is owned and managed by the founder for all official correspondence, including verification requests and educational queries.
Official Website: https://www.wdu-trust.com – Hosts all transparency documents and project details, serving as the central resource for independent checks.
Source Code Repository: https://github.com/wdutrust/wdu – Publicly available for code review and verification, allowing audits of BEP-20 compliance.
All official communications, including those for blockchain explorers like BscScan, documentation verification, or project identity confirmation, are conducted exclusively through these channels. Emails from non-domain addresses (e.g., Gmail or other providers) are not official and should be disregarded. This policy prevents impersonation and ensures authenticity, with all interactions focused on educational and transparency topics.

Project Ownership & Human Responsibility
BscScan requires clear, transparent information about the project's responsible individuals. Below, we provide detailed, verifiable details about the founder, including their role and limitations. There is no misrepresentation of any public entities or other projects; all statements are original and factual. This section addresses disclosure needs by outlining exact responsibilities and emphasizing the non-financial nature.

Project Founder & Sole Owner:
woodi usimo

The project founder is the original deployer of the WDU Trust smart contract and holds responsibility for:

Deployment and verification of the smart contract on BscScan (verified on 2025-12-18).
Accuracy and consistency of all public documentation, ensuring it aligns with on-chain data and BEP-20 standards.
Maintenance of the official website, repositories, and transparency pages, including updates for clarity.
Communication with blockchain explorers, such as providing clarifications for BscScan reviews or educational explanations.
Ensuring the project remains non-financial and educational only, with no promotional activities.
From a technical and economic perspective, the founder does not possess the ability to:

Mint or burn tokens – no mint/burn functions in the contract, preventing supply changes.
Modify total supply – fixed at 700,000,000,000,000 tokens forever.
Freeze or restrict token transfers – no pause or blacklist features, ensuring free movement.
Introduce fees, taxes, or economic controls – fully BEP-20 compliant with no additions.
Alter user balances or interfere with transactions – contract is immutable and decentralized.
This clear separation of human accountability (for documentation and transparency) from on-chain immutability (no control over tokens or transfers) ensures the project aligns with decentralized principles while maintaining identifiable responsibility for public information. The founder's role is limited to non-technical support, promoting trust through verifiability.

Core Team Members & Limited Roles
The core team consists of two publicly identifiable individuals with clearly defined, limited roles focused on transparency, education, and compliance support. Each member's role is expanded here for full clarity, along with their responsibilities, and public professional profiles (equivalents to LinkedIn, including X for announcements, Medium for articles, Instagram for outreach, Telegram for communication, Bitcointalk for forum presence). These profiles allow independent verification of their expertise in blockchain and documentation. The team is small, identifiable, and focused on non-financial support. No anonymous members exist, and there is no distortion of any public entities or projects. This disclosure directly addresses BscScan's requirements for team transparency.
