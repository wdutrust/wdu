Project Identity, Ownership & Accountability

WDU Trust Token (WDU) • Maximum Public Identity Disclosure & Explorer Compliance Page

1. Project Identity & Clear Public Definition – Detailed Overview
WDU Trust Token is a **completely independent, non-corporate blockchain educational project** deployed exclusively on the BNB Smart Chain using the standard BEP-20 token protocol.

The project consists of a **single, immutable smart contract** (verified on BscScan since December 18, 2025), accompanied by open, truthful documentation, fully disclosed ownership, and publicly identifiable contributors. Its only goal is to serve as a **real-world, on-chain reference** for how a minimal, transparent, and predictable BEP-20 token can exist without complexity, hidden features, or financial mechanics.

WDU Trust Token is **explicitly NOT** a company, foundation, DAO, investment platform, financial service, startup, or profit-oriented entity. It does **not** operate under any registered corporate structure, does **not** represent shares, securities, equity, or any form of ownership rights, and does **not** generate or promise profits, yields, or returns.

This project was conceived, coded, deployed, and documented entirely by Woodi Usimo starting in 2025 as a personal initiative to promote genuine transparency in the token space after observing numerous opaque or misleading launches. Every element — contract logic, website structure, documentation wording, supply choice (700 trillion for extreme divisibility demonstration), and public communications — is 100% original work created from scratch without copying templates, phrases, layouts, or concepts from any other educational token projects, blockchain demonstrations, or public sources. The uniqueness is evident in the specific founder story, chosen parameters, and commitment to linking verifiable GitHub repositories and Bitcointalk threads rather than generic social-only presence.

3. Core Team Members – Non-Anonymous with Multiple Public Professional Profiles
The core team consists of **two publicly identifiable individuals** (in addition to the founder) who contribute to documentation, review, and transparency efforts. Each member maintains **multiple active, verifiable professional profiles** commonly used in the blockchain/Web3 space (equivalent to LinkedIn: X for public visibility, Medium for articles, Instagram for outreach, Telegram for direct communication, Bitcointalk for forum discussions, GitHub for code contributions, email for official contact). These profiles contain original content related to blockchain education, transparency, and this project specifically — no anonymous or pseudonymous accounts.

All profiles are **active, publicly linked to the project**, and contain **original contributions** (e.g., articles on token transparency, code snippets for BEP-20 demos, discussions on blockchain education). There are **no anonymous team members** or contributors — every individual is named with verifiable online presence. This level of disclosure exceeds standard requirements to provide maximum clarity for BscScan and public review.

4. Responsibility Framework – What We Control and What We Don't
Direct Responsibilities (Founder & Team):

Accuracy and maintenance of off-chain documentation (website, Medium articles, disclosures) – ensured consistent with on-chain facts
Public source code verification on BscScan and GitHub repositories – code matches deployed contract
Moderation and factual content on official communication channels – no promotion or speculation
Response to transparency inquiries from explorers like BscScan or public auditors – full cooperation
Educational content creation demonstrating BEP-20 standards and immutability – for learning purposes
Explicitly No Control or Responsibility Over:

On-chain token transfers, balances, or interactions – fully decentralized and user-controlled
Token supply changes, minting, or burning – impossible due to contract design
Any financial outcomes, market prices, liquidity, or trading – no involvement
User actions, wallet security, or transaction risks – voluntary and at user's risk
Third-party listings, integrations, or unauthorized channels – no endorsements
This clear division ensures accountability for what we manage (transparency and education) while respecting blockchain decentralization for on-chain elements.

5. Strict Non-Misrepresentation & Independence Policy
WDU Trust Token and its documentation **do not** represent, impersonate, copy from, or distort any:

Public entities, governments, regulators, financial institutions, or official organizations
Binance, BNB Chain team, BscScan, or any blockchain infrastructure providers (no affiliation)
Existing blockchain projects, tokens, educational demonstrations, or protocols (including any similarly themed transparency-focused tokens on BSC or other chains)
Any trademarks, names, official statements, or visual/structural elements from other sources
All names (wdutrust / wdu), descriptions, supply rationale, graphics (if any), texts, page layouts, and representations across official resources are **100% original creations**, written and developed specifically for this project by the disclosed team. Any superficial similarities to standard transparency phrasing are unavoidable due to common blockchain terminology, but the core narrative, personal founder motivation, exact parameters, and linked professional profiles are unique and traceable only to WDU Trust. Every claim is backed exclusively by **public on-chain data**, **verified contract source code**, and **original documentation**.
