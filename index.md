Project Purpose – Educational & Transparency Demonstration Only
WDU Trust Token is designed exclusively as a live, on-chain example of how a clean, simple BEP-20 token can operate with maximum transparency on a public blockchain. It demonstrates key concepts like fixed supply mechanics, smart contract immutability, and public verifiability without any unnecessary complexity.

The token has a fixed total supply of 700,000,000,000,000 WDU, minted entirely at deployment with no possibility of additional creation. This choice of a large supply number serves to illustrate concepts of token divisibility and precision in blockchain systems (18 decimals allow for fine-grained fractions). All parameters are permanently verifiable on-chain.

Contract Address (BscScan Verified): 0x74D7d1aD19bD14655cD0Ab26BEcc57ED69d69413
Source Code Verified: December 18, 2025 – Full contract details, bytecode, and ABI publicly available for audit.

Founder & Team Identity – Full Public Disclosure
Founder & Deployer: woodi usimo – the original creator and contract deployer. Full public disclosure with direct accountability for all project aspects, including deployment, verification, and transparency maintenance.

Important Non-Financial Declaration – Comprehensive Clarification
WDU Trust Token is NOT and will NEVER be:

An investment product or anything that could be interpreted as offering financial returns
A security, equity, share, or any form of ownership claim
Subject to any ICO, IEO, IDO, presale, public sale, private sale, or token distribution event
Part of any staking, yield farming, liquidity mining, reward, airdrop, or incentive program
Promising, implying, or even hinting at profit, value appreciation, price increase, or any economic benefit
Associated with fundraising, capital raising, donations, revenue sharing, or any monetary collection mechanism
Designed or marketed for trading, speculation, or market participation
This token exists exclusively as an open-source educational and technical reference example. It has zero financial utility, zero monetization intent, and is provided freely for learning blockchain fundamentals, smart contract verification, and on-chain transparency practices. Any use beyond education is at the user's sole discretion and risk — no expectations should be formed.

Smart Contract Characteristics – Detailed Security & Immutability Analysis
✗ No mint function (supply fixed forever at deployment – impossible to inflate)
✗ No burn function (no way to arbitrarily reduce supply or affect holders)
✗ No transaction fee / tax / redistribution / reflection logic (transfers are pure 1:1)
✗ No blacklist, pause, freeze, honeypot, or any restriction functions
✗ No upgradeable proxy / implementation pattern (code is final and immutable)
✗ No owner control over user balances (cannot seize, move, or modify holdings)
✓ Source code fully verified on BscScan (bytecode matches published Solidity exactly)
✓ Behavior permanently defined by on-chain bytecode (no hidden logic possible)
✓ Minimal code surface area – reduces potential vulnerabilities and simplifies audits
✓ Standard BEP-20 events emitted correctly for every transfer/approval
This ultra-minimal design was intentional to serve as the safest possible example for students and developers learning Solidity and token standards. All claims can be independently confirmed via BscScan's "Contract" tab.
