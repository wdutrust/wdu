Cryptographic Ownership & Deployer Verification
WDU Trust Token (WDU) – BNB Smart Chain – Maximum On-Chain Accountability Proof


1. Purpose, Context & Strong Transparency Motivation
This dedicated page exists exclusively to deliver clear, technical, cryptographically secure, and independently verifiable proof that links the WDU Trust smart contract to its publicly declared human project owner and deployer. The token is a standard BEP-20 on BNB Smart Chain, fully compliant with all specifications, and exists solely for educational transparency purposes.

It directly and comprehensively addresses common blockchain explorer review concerns, especially those raised by BscScan and similar platforms, including:

Lack of clear, provable project ownership and human accountability – Addressed with team profiles and cryptographic evidence.
Absence of verifiable identity behind the deployer wallet – Provided through this on-chain signature proof.
Reliance on mere text claims without cryptographic backing – Fully resolved with verifiable signature.
Potential risk of misrepresentation, impersonation, or untraceable control – Eliminated with zero-trust cryptography.
This page relies solely on standard blockchain cryptography — a mathematical, zero-trust method to prove private key control over the deployer wallet. This is the gold standard for on-chain identity verification used worldwide on Ethereum-compatible chains like BNB Smart Chain.

All content is 100% specific to WDU Trust, completely original, and not copied, adapted, or derived from any external project, public institution, or unrelated entity. The project remains strictly educational — no financial product, investment opportunity, or commercial intent.

2. Explanation of Cryptographic Verification – Simple & Detailed
Blockchain networks like BNB Smart Chain use asymmetric cryptography (public/private key pairs) to prove ownership without ever revealing the private key.

To prove control, the following steps are performed:

The wallet owner signs a human-readable message using their private key (which is never shared or exposed).
This produces a unique cryptographic signature (a long hexadecimal string).
Anyone can independently verify the signature using public tools: if it matches the message and wallet address, it mathematically proves the signer controls the private key of that address.
This method is:

Zero-trust — No need to trust any party; verification is mathematical.
Publicly verifiable — Anyone can check using BscScan, MyEtherWallet, MetaMask sign/verify, or other tools.
Immutable & tamper-proof — The signature is permanent and cannot be faked without the private key.
For WDU Trust, this cryptographic proof demonstrates that the deployer wallet (which created the contract and received the initial supply) is controlled by the declared founder, fulfilling BscScan's requirements for non-anonymous and accountable ownership.

3. Deployer Wallet Address & Token Context
Deployer & Owner Wallet Address (Signing Address):
0x059ca52a1436cc4e9f6a8aaeaafed462d0645e

This wallet:

Deployed the WDU Trust contract on BNB Smart Chain.
Received/holds the initial minted supply (verifiable on BscScan via deployment transaction).
Has no special powers over the token – The contract is fully immutable with no owner functions for changes, minting, burning, or pausing.
Contract Address: 0x74D7d1aD19bD14655cD0Ab26BEcc57ED69d69413 – Source code verified on BscScan on December 18, 2025.

4. Full Signed Message, Signature & Verification Details
Signed Message (Exact Text – Must be copied exactly for verification):
I, woodi usimo, am the founder, sole owner, and original deployer of the WDU Trust Token (WDU), a strictly educational immutable BEP-20 token on BNB Smart Chain. Contract address: 0x74D7d1aD19bD14655cD0Ab26BEcc57ED69d69413. Total supply: 700000000000000 (fixed forever). This cryptographic message is signed using the deployer wallet private key to publicly prove my non-anonymous identity, full responsibility, and accountability for this project on https://www.wdu-trust.com for blockchain explorer transparency review (including BscScan) as of January 2026. No financial purpose, no investment, no misrepresentation of any entity or project.
Cryptographic Signature Hash (Full Hex – Verified on BscScan):
0xc325b5636319dcbd630f7fa1a60df3ec260b14d2a4801b565c53e347392987032d1fce4720a44d448a0e5539f29fdd7fb352e85303886a67fa7d081ad2927b321b
This signature can only be generated by the private key holder of the deployer address — it is mathematically impossible to produce otherwise. It serves as irrefutable on-chain proof of control.

5. Independent, Public & Third-Party Verification Instructions
The signature is already published and verified on BscScan — anyone can check it directly.

How anyone can verify independently (even without the direct link):

Go to BscScan Verified Signatures tool: https://bscscan.com/verifiedSignatures → Select "Verify Signature" tab.
Enter Address: 0x059ca52a1436cc4e9f6a8aaeaafed462d0645e
Paste the exact Signed Message text above (copy from section 4).
Enter the Signature Hash above.
Click "Verify Signature" → It will confirm "Valid" and match the published #15169.
Alternative tools: MyEtherWallet (Sign/Verify Message), MetaMask (Sign/Verify feature), or any EIP-191 compatible verifier.

This proves beyond any doubt the deployer identity using pure cryptography.

6. Compliance Scope & Explicit Limitations – No Extra Powers
This cryptographic proof is provided solely for transparency, accountability, and BscScan compliance — it does not grant or imply any additional rights or features.

It does NOT:

Grant new permissions to the deployer/owner – No mint, burn, pause, or tax functions exist.
Allow contract upgrades, modifications, proxies, or replacements – The contract is permanently immutable.
Enable any control over user balances, transfers, or token economics – Standard BEP-20 only.
Provide financial authority, yield, or value representation – Project is non-financial and educational.
Introduce governance, voting, DAO structures, or off-chain control – No such mechanisms.
The contract remains immutable, minimal, and strictly BEP-20 compliant — source code publicly verified on BscScan.
