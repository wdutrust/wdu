WDU Trust Token (WDU) • Official & Verifiable Resources

1. Purpose of This Page
This page provides a complete, authoritative, and expanded list of all official public communication channels, social profiles, and verification resources associated with the WDU Trust Token (WDU). We have detailed each channel with explanations of its purpose, management, and usage to ensure full transparency about the project and token.

The WDU Trust Token is a standard BEP-20 token on the BNB Smart Chain, fully compliant with BEP-20 specifications (including totalSupply, balanceOf, transfer, transferFrom, approve, allowance functions and Transfer/Approval events). It exists solely for educational and transparency demonstration purposes, with no financial features, no mint/burn/tax logic, and fixed supply of 700,000,000,000,000 tokens minted once at deployment. This page exists specifically to support identity verification, ownership transparency, team accountability, and independent review by blockchain explorers, including BscScan. All information is factual, verifiable, 100% original to this project, and free from any misrepresentation of public entities or other projects.

This detailed disclosure directly addresses common explorer review points: clear project description, verifiable founder and team identities via multiple public professional profiles, and explicit confirmation of originality and non-financial intent.

2. Scope & Usage Policy of Public Channels
WDU Trust Token maintains a limited number of public channels solely for transparency, documentation, educational reference, and verification of project details. These channels provide clear information about the token's technical characteristics (BEP-20 compliance, immutable supply, no admin privileges over user balances), team identities, and strictly non-financial nature, helping users and reviewers understand the project without ambiguity.

These channels are not used for:

Marketing or brand promotion – No ads or hype.
Investment solicitation or token sales – No fundraising.
Price discussion, trading signals, or speculation – No market commentary.
Community governance, voting, or decision-making – No DAO features.
Any form of financial advice, yield farming, staking, or rewards – Strictly educational.
All content shared via these channels is **factual, on-chain verifiable**, and aligned with the project's educational mission. Channels are moderated directly by the disclosed team to maintain accuracy and prevent misinformation.
