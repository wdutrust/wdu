Official Communication & Email Disclosure

WDU Trust Token (WDU) • Explorer Verification Reference

1. Purpose of This Page
This page exists to clearly disclose, define, and limit the official email and communication channels associated with the WDU Trust Token project. It has been expanded with detailed, repetitive, and simple explanations to ensure complete clarity, prevent any possible confusion, and fully satisfy blockchain explorer review requirements — especially those of BscScan (clear team/founder identity, verifiable professional profiles, no misrepresentation, non-financial intent).

The primary goals of this page are:

Blockchain explorer verification correspondence (e.g., BscScan token info updates, clarifications, etc.)
Public confirmation of identity, ownership, and accountability of the project and responsible individuals
Documentation clarification, correction, or additional evidence when requested by public entities or reviewers
Anti-impersonation protection, authenticity validation, and warning against fake communications
Explicit demonstration that all official communication is strictly non-financial, educational, and transparency-focused
By publishing this information openly and in exhaustive detail, we help eliminate confusion, impersonation risks, and any misunderstanding about who controls official project communication. This page contains no promotional, financial, or speculative content whatsoever.

2. Official Project Email – Primary & Exclusive Channel
The single, exclusive, and only official email address representing the WDU Trust Token project is:

wdu@wdu-trust.com

This email address is:

Owned, registered, and controlled directly by the project founder (woodi usimo)
Registered under the official project domain (wdu-trust.com)
Monitored and managed personally by the founder for all project-related verification, transparency, and clarification matters
The only address authorized to issue official statements on behalf of the project
Any message sent from this exact address carries the full personal responsibility and accountability of the founder. No other email address — personal, team, or third-party — is authorized to represent or speak for WDU Trust Token.

3. Responsibility & Identity Control – Full Accountability
All messages sent from wdu@wdu-trust.com are issued under the direct personal responsibility of:

Founder & Sole Project Owner:
woodi usimo

This individual is:

The original deployer of the smart contract (address: 0x74D7d1aD19bD14655cD0Ab26BEcc57ED69d69413)
The person who verified the source code on BscScan (2025-12-18)
The maintainer of the official website, domain, and all transparency documentation
The individual fully accountable for all public statements, verifications, and compliance with explorer standards
Publicly identifiable via professional profiles: GitHub, Medium, Bitcointalk thread
Important clarification: This email address does not represent:

A company, corporation, or registered business
A foundation, DAO, or decentralized organization
Any legal entity or commercial operation
A service provider, support team, or customer service operation
The project is an independent, educational blockchain demonstration maintained solely by identifiable, non-anonymous individuals.

4. Scope of Permitted Communication – Strict Limitations
The official project email (wdu@wdu-trust.com) is used exclusively and strictly for the following non-financial purposes:

Responding to blockchain explorer verification requests (BscScan token info updates, clarifications, etc.)
Providing identity, ownership, and team confirmation when required by reviewers
Clarifying or correcting documentation, statements, or public information
Assisting with anti-impersonation checks and authenticity validation
Answering direct questions related to on-chain data, transparency pages, or technical verification
The email is explicitly NOT used and will never be used for:

Token sales, presales, ICO/IDO, fundraising, donations, or any capital-related communication
User support, wallet help, onboarding, technical troubleshooting for individuals
Trading, exchange listings, liquidity, market data, or price discussions
Partnerships, business inquiries, sponsorships, collaborations, or commercial proposals
Private messages, giveaways, airdrops, reward coordination, or incentive programs
Any financial, speculative, economic, investment, or profit-related topics
This narrow and rigidly enforced scope ensures the email remains a pure tool for transparency, verification, and compliance — nothing more.

5. Non-Official & Impersonation Warning – Strong Protection
Any email communication originating from addresses outside the @wdu-trust.com domain must be considered unofficial, unauthorized, and non-representative of the WDU Trust Token project.

Examples of non-official / fake / impersonating email domains include (but are not limited to):

Gmail (…@gmail.com)
Yahoo (…@yahoo.com)
ProtonMail (…@proton.me / …@protonmail.com)
Outlook / Hotmail (…@outlook.com / …@hotmail.com)
Any free, personal, or third-party email provider
Any domain not exactly ending in @wdu-trust.com
If you receive messages claiming to be from WDU Trust Token but using a different domain, sender name variation, or suspicious content, treat them as potential impersonation attempts and do not respond or engage. Only trust communications originating from wdu@wdu-trust.com. Report suspicious emails to the official address for verification.

6. Supporting Team Contact Emails (Verification Only)
For secondary verification purposes only (e.g., confirming technical details, documentation accuracy, or GitHub/Medium/Bitcointalk content), core team members maintain individual domain-based email addresses tied to the official project domain:

mekro deo – mekrodeo@wdu-trust.com
Role: Technical documentation, smart contract review support, educational content creation.
Professional Profiles: GitHub, Medium, Bitcointalk, X (@mekrodeo), Telegram (@mekrodeo), Facebook, Instagram
btmb ani – btmbani@wdu-trust.com
Role: Community communication, documentation support, public channel moderation.
Professional Profiles: GitHub, Medium, Bitcointalk, X (@btmbani), Telegram (@btmbani), Instagram
These team emails are used strictly for verification, technical clarification, and internal project coordination. They do not provide:

Public interaction, general inquiries, or user support
Financial, investment, or commercial communication of any kind
Token-related services, wallet help, or personal assistance
All official project-wide statements, declarations, and explorer communications come exclusively from wdu@wdu-trust.com.

7. Non-Financial & Compliance Statement – Repeated for Clarity
WDU Trust Token operates strictly as an educational and transparency-focused blockchain demonstration project. The WDU token is a simple, fixed-supply (700 trillion), immutable BEP-20 token with no financial mechanisms, no mint/burn/tax logic, and no economic features.

No communication sent or received via the official email (or any team emails) implies, suggests, involves, or allows:

Financial activity, investment opportunity, or profit expectation
Token sales, fundraising, capital raising, or donations
Commercial service, business inquiry, or partnership discussion
Economic participation, value discussion, or speculation
Any form of user support beyond transparency verification
This disclosure is published solely to meet and exceed blockchain explorer transparency, identity, and verification standards (including BscScan requirements for clear team disclosure and non-misleading information). All information is factual, consistent with on-chain data, original to this project, and free from any misrepresentation.
