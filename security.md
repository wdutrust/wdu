Security, Ownership & Transparency Statement

Introduction & Purpose

This document serves as an official, detailed, expanded, and permanent clarification regarding the authenticity, ownership, technical integrity, transparency, and strictly non-commercial, non-financial nature of the WDU Trust Token (WDU) project. We have expanded this page with clear, in-depth explanations, verifiable proofs, and comprehensive details to fully address BscScan's requirements for transparent information about the token, project, founder, team members (with professional profiles), and overall structure.

This page is published specifically to meet blockchain explorer review requirements, including but not limited to BscScan project verification, smart contract transparency, signature validation (Verifysig), and team disclosure. It provides factual evidence of ownership, security features, social channels, and team identities, all verifiable on-chain or through public professional profiles. This ensures no anonymity, no misrepresentation, and full compliance with BEP-20 standards.

All information herein is factual, independently verifiable on-chain, non-promotional, and provided solely to eliminate ambiguity, misinterpretation, or misleading assumptions. The project is educational only, with absolutely no financial elements, no promises of value, and no distortions from public entities or other projects. This is repeated for emphasis to align with BscScan's focus on clarity and non-misleading content.

1. Official Website Authenticity & Domain Control
The domain https://www.wdu-trust.com is the one and only official website associated with the WDU Trust project. This domain is registered, owned, and directly controlled by the project founder (woodi usimo) under the WDU Trust name, with no third-party involvement, intermediaries, or delegated access.

To ensure authenticity and security, the website uses secure HTTPS protocol with SSL encryption, and all content is static without dynamic elements that could be exploited or lead to vulnerabilities. No third-party hosting services with shared control, proxy ownership, white-label platforms, or delegated domain management are used. Domain registration details can be verified through public WHOIS lookups, confirming the founder's control.

There are no mirror websites, no alternative domains, no subdomains, and no translated clones authorized to represent this project. Any such sites should be considered unauthorized, unaffiliated, and potentially fraudulent. This policy is in place to protect users and ensure absolute transparency.

The website's content is original, not copied from any public entities or other projects, and focuses solely on educational disclosures without any financial implications.

2. Website Security & Technical Integrity
The official website is intentionally designed as a static informational site to maximize security, minimize attack surfaces, and ensure reliability. It contains no interactive features that could be vulnerable to attacks, data breaches, or misuse. Specifically:

No user accounts, registrations, or authentication systems – Eliminates risks of data breaches or unauthorized access.
No login forms, contact forms, or data collection mechanisms – No personal information is ever requested or stored.
No cookies, local storage, or tracking mechanisms – Fully respects user privacy with zero behavioral tracking.
No analytics services (e.g., Google Analytics, Meta Pixel) or third-party tracking scripts – No monitoring of user activity.
No JavaScript frameworks, dynamic scripts, or external embeds – Reduces vulnerability to cross-site scripting or injections.
No API connections, blockchain wallets, or interactive tools – Purely informational, with links to public explorers only.
The website does not host or link to token sales, swaps, claim pages, dashboards, staking interfaces, investment portals, or any financial tools. Its sole function is to provide public disclosure, educational materials, team profiles, and long-form documentation for verification purposes, all in compliance with BscScan standards.

Security is further ensured through regular updates to the hosting environment, monitoring for unauthorized changes, and adherence to best practices for static site deployment. The site is hosted on a secure platform with SSL encryption and no server-side vulnerabilities.

3. Social Channel Authenticity & Control
All official social channels are owned and controlled directly by the project team, with no third-party management. These channels are used solely for transparency updates, educational clarifications, and non-promotional information sharing. Here are the verified channels:

X (Twitter): https://x.com/wdutrust – Controlled by founder; used for transparency announcements.
Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/wdutrust – Official page for project disclosures.
Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/wdu.trustwdu/ – For educational visuals and updates.
Telegram: https://t.me/wdutrust – Channel for clarifications only, no promotions.

Bitcointalk: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5570556.0 – Official thread for discussions.
GitHub: https://github.com/wdutrust/wdu – Repository for source code and docs.
These channels post only factual, educational content with no hype, speculation, or financial claims. Any other accounts claiming affiliation are unauthorized. Users should verify handles against this list to avoid scams.

4. Project Ownership & Team Transparency
Ownership is fully disclosed and verifiable through on-chain proofs and public profiles. The founder and team are non-anonymous, with professional links provided for BscScan compliance:

Founder: woodi usimo – Deployer and primary contact. Profiles: X | GitHub.
mekro deo – Technical support. Profiles: X | Medium | Instagram | Telegram | Facebook | Bitcointalk | GitHub.
btmb ani – Documentation support. Profiles: X | Medium | Bitcointalk | Instagram | Telegram | GitHub.
No hidden members or affiliations exist. All are verifiable and focused on educational transparency.

5. Token Security Features & Non-Financial Nature
The token is a standard BEP-20 with minimal, secure design:

Immutable code – No upgrades or changes possible.
Fixed supply – No mint/burn functions.
No owner privileges – Cannot freeze, tax, or control.
Verified source code – Public on BscScan.
No financial features – No staking, rewards, or utility.
This ensures security and prevents misuse. The project is non-financial, with no value promises.

6. Team Structure & Responsibility
The WDU Trust project is maintained by a small, publicly identifiable team of real individuals. Their roles are limited to non-financial activities like documentation and transparency maintenance. BscScan requires clear team disclosure with professional profiles, which are provided above and in the team page for full verification.

woodi usimo: Oversees transparency and compliance.
mekro deo: Handles technical reviews and docs.
btmb ani: Coordinates public information.
Team members are responsible solely for documentation, transparency, and public disclosure. No financial management, token distributions, or custodial services are offered. All members are accountable and verifiable through their profiles.

7. Legal Position & Risk Clarification
WDU Trust is a transparency-oriented blockchain reference project with no legal entity status, no financial operations, and no affiliations.

It does not provide financial advice, investment opportunities, guarantees, or services. Any interaction with the token is entirely voluntary and at the user's sole discretion and responsibility.

The project disclaims all liability related to speculative use, third-party listings, external market activity, or any risks beyond the team's control, such as blockchain network issues, wallet errors, or user mistakes.

8. BscScan Review & Signature Verification – On-Chain Proof of Ownership
To provide undeniable proof of ownership as required by BscScan, the project has completed on-chain verification steps, including smart contract source code verification and a signed message validation (Verifysig).

The verified signature (#15169 on BscScan) confirms the founder's ownership:

Signer Address: 0x059ca52a1436cc4e9f6a8aaeaafed462d0645e – This is the wallet used to deploy the contract.
Message: "I, woodi usimo, am the founder, sole owner, and original deployer of the WDU Trust Token (WDU), a strictly educational immutable BEP-20 token on BNB Smart Chain. Contract address: 0x74D7d1aD19bD14655cD0Ab26BEcc57ED69d69413. Total supply: 700000000000000 (fixed forever). This cryptographic message is signed using the deployer wallet private key to publicly prove my non-anonymous identity, full responsibility, and accountability for this project on https://www.wdu-trust.com for blockchain explorer transparency review (including BscScan) as of January 2026.

Signature Hash: 0xc325b5636319dcbd630f7fa1a60df3ec260b14d2a4801b565c53e347392987032d1fce4720a44d448a0e5539f29fdd7fb352e85303886a67fa7d081ad2927b321b
View the full verification on BscScan: https://bscscan.com/verifySig/15169. This on-chain proof demonstrates that the signer controls the deployer wallet, which holds the initial supply, with no distributions made.

This page exists explicitly to support manual review processes by blockchain explorers and to provide extended clarity where short summaries are insufficient. All claims can be independently verified via the contract page on BscScan.

This statement is final, factual, and published in good faith to ensure maximum clarity, transparency, and public understanding.
