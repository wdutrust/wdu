Project Ownership, Control & Accountability Disclosure

WDU Trust Token (WDU) – BNB Smart Chain – Full Public Responsibility Proof


1. Clear Project Definition & Maximum Transparency Statement
WDU Trust Token (ticker: WDU) is a **standard BEP-20 token** deployed on BNB Smart Chain — **not** a company, foundation, DAO, investment platform, financial service, or legal entity of any kind. It is a **transparent, independent, educational on-chain demonstration** with **full human accountability** assigned to named, non-anonymous individuals.

This page is created and expanded specifically to address BscScan and blockchain explorer requirements for:

Clear, non-anonymous project ownership and control disclosure
Identifiable founder and team members with multiple verifiable professional public profiles (GitHub for code activity, Medium for technical articles, Bitcointalk for forum presence and announcement thread, project emails)
Accurate, truthful, original, and non-misleading information with no distortion or borrowing from other projects or public entities
Elimination of anonymity, hidden control, or ambiguity regarding responsibility
Confirmation of strict BEP-20 compliance and permanent immutability
All content on this page and throughout the project is **100% original**, written specifically for WDU Trust Token, and **not derived, copied, adapted, or inspired** from any external entity, project, template, or public source. Any superficial similarity to common transparency phrasing is due only to standard blockchain terminology.

2. Definition of Ownership – Strictly Technical & Accountability Role
"Owner" in this context refers **exclusively** to a limited technical and accountability role:

The individual who deployed the smart contract
The person who submitted and verified the source code on BscScan (2025-12-18)
The maintainer of the official website, domain, and all transparency documentation
The primary human contact point for explorer verifications, clarifications, and accountability
Ownership **does NOT** include or allow:

Any financial custody, user fund control, or asset management
Ability to mint, burn, freeze, seize, modify balances, or interfere with transfers
Governance, voting, decision-making, or custodial powers
Any economic influence or profit-related authority
This narrow definition prevents any confusion between technical deployment responsibility and prohibited financial or centralized control. All limitations are hard-coded in the verified contract.

3. Explicit Absence of DAO, Multisig, Hidden Control or Third Parties
WDU Trust Token is **not** governed, influenced, or controlled by any collective, anonymous, decentralized, or third-party structure.

We explicitly confirm the complete absence of:

DAO structures, multisig wallets, shared signing, or group control mechanisms
Anonymous clusters, hidden admins, proxy controllers, or undisclosed operators
Companies, foundations, trusts, legal entities, or corporate involvement
Off-chain voting, indirect influence, or external decision-making bodies
Any form of delegated, automated, or smart-contract-governed authority beyond the deployer
All accountability is **directly and personally traceable** to the named founder and core team members — fully aligned with BscScan's expectations for clear, non-anonymous responsibility.

4. Founder & Project Owner – Full Identity & Accountability Disclosure

Medium: https://medium.com/@wdutrust.wdu – original technical/educational articles
Bitcointalk Announcement Thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5570556.0 – public proof of presence and updates
5. On-Chain Technical Authority – Hard-Coded & Permanent Limitations
The smart contract permanently and irreversibly restricts any "owner" privileges:

Cannot mint new tokens (no mint function exists)
Cannot burn or reduce supply (no burn function exists)
Cannot apply fees, taxes, reflections, or redistributions
Cannot freeze, blacklist, pause, or restrict transfers
Cannot upgrade contract or change core logic (no proxy/upgrade pattern)
Cannot seize, move, confiscate, or modify any user balances
The only possible owner action is minor metadata update (token name/symbol) — this is non-economic, fully logged on-chain, and has no impact on token economics, supply, or user holdings. It is strongly recommended to renounce even this limited ownership for maximum decentralization proof.

6. Core Team Members – Detailed Roles & Public Professional Profiles
The project is supported by a small, fully disclosed, non-anonymous core team with strictly off-chain, non-financial, transparency-focused roles. No team member has any on-chain control, wallet authority, or economic influence.
