Official Token Information & Transparency Statement

WDU Trust Token (WDU) – BNB Smart Chain

Introduction & Purpose
This page is provided specifically for blockchain explorer verification, including BscScan, and for public transparency. It contains complete, factual, and expanded information about the identity, ownership, technical structure, and non-financial nature of the project. We have detailed each section with simple explanations to ensure clarity and address any concerns about the token or project. The WDU Trust Token is a straightforward educational tool on the BNB Smart Chain, designed to show how basic blockchain tokens work without any financial aspects. To further clarify, this document serves as a comprehensive resource that breaks down every element, allowing independent verification and aligning with standards like BscScan's requirements for clear project information.

This document is purely informational and educational. It does NOT contain any promotional, investment, or financial content. No discussions about prices, profits, or trading are included, as the focus is solely on transparency and verification. We've expanded this to emphasize that all content is original and free from any misrepresentation of other projects or public entities.

1. Project Identification & On-Chain Metadata
WDU Trust Token (WDU) is a standard BEP-20 token deployed on the BNB Smart Chain. All token parameters are permanently recorded on-chain and can be independently verified through BscScan or any compatible explorer. To make this clear, we've expanded the details below with explanations of each element, why it's important, and how to verify it. For instance, BEP-20 is the token standard on BSC, ensuring it works seamlessly with wallets and other tools. This compliance means the token behaves predictably and securely, just like other BEP-20 tokens, and we've included step-by-step verification guidance.

The purpose of publishing these details is to eliminate ambiguity and provide clear identification for reviewers and users. Everything is verifiable on-chain, with no distortions from other projects or public entities. This section addresses BscScan concerns by offering exhaustive, transparent token information.

Token Name: wdutrust – A unique name for identification, not imitating any other project.
Symbol: wdu – Short ticker symbol for easy reference.
Standard: BEP-20 – Fully compliant with BEP-20 specifications, including transfer and balance functions, ensuring ecosystem compatibility.
Network: BNB Smart Chain – The blockchain platform, chosen for its efficiency and transparency features.
Decimals: 18 – Standard precision for token units, allowing fine divisibility.
Total Supply: 700000000000000 (700 trillion tokens, fixed and immutable) – All minted at once, with no further issuance possible.
Contract Address: 0x74D7d1aD19bD14655cD0Ab26BEcc57ED69d69413 – Direct link to BscScan for verification, where you can view transactions and code.
Source Code Status: Fully Verified on BscScan on 2025-12-18 – Code is public and matches the deployed contract, enabling community audits.
Initial Mint: One-time mint at deployment only – No further creation possible, verifiable via deployment transaction on BscScan.
No additional tokens can ever be created. The supply cannot be increased, modified, or reissued. This is enforced by the contract code, which anyone can review. To verify: Go to the contract address on BscScan, check the totalSupply function, and review the source code for absence of mint functions.

2. Project Purpose (Clear, Neutral & Non-Financial)
WDU Trust Token exists solely as an educational and transparency-focused blockchain reference project. We've expanded this to explain in simple terms: It's like a sample code for learning about tokens, not for making money. The project demonstrates basic token mechanics in a verifiable way.

Its objective is to demonstrate how a simple, fixed-supply, fully verifiable BEP-20 token operates on-chain. This helps developers and enthusiasts understand blockchain basics without complexity, including concepts like immutability and decentralization.

The token is used for:

Technical learning – Studying smart contract code and behavior in detail.
Smart contract demonstration – Showing how tokens are minted and transferred step-by-step.
Testing and experimentation – Safe environment for blockchain trials, with guides on verification.
Public verification of blockchain behavior – Allowing anyone to check on-chain data independently.
The project does NOT pursue commercial, financial, or speculative activities. All focus is on education and transparency, with no distortions or misrepresentations. This aligns with BscScan's need for clear project information.

3. Explicit Non-Financial Declaration
To avoid misunderstanding, the project explicitly confirms that it is NOT any kind of financial tool. We've detailed this further to emphasize each point, ensuring full transparency.

An investment product: No expectation of returns or value appreciation.
A security or share: No ownership rights or equity representation.
A fundraising vehicle: No money raised or solicited.
A profit-generating instrument: No earnings mechanisms or incentives.
A revenue-sharing mechanism: No distributions or dividends.
The project has NEVER conducted and will NEVER conduct:

ICO / IEO / IDO: No offerings of any kind.
Private or public token sales: No sales events or distributions for value.
Presales or fundraising rounds: No capital seeking activities.
Airdrops with financial incentives: No giveaways implying economic value.
Staking, yield, or reward programs: No locking mechanisms for returns.
Any form of capital raising: Strictly educational focus only.
No financial value or profit potential is implied. This expanded declaration ensures no ambiguity regarding the project's intent.

4. Contract Security & Immutability Features
The contract is designed for maximum transparency and minimal risk. We've expanded this section to detail each feature, explaining how it contributes to security and why it's included. The contract is a basic BEP-20 without extras, reducing potential vulnerabilities.

No minting post-deployment: Supply fixed forever, no inflation possible.
No burn mechanisms: Total supply remains constant, no reductions.
No taxes or fees on transfers: Simple transfers without deductions.
No blacklist or whitelist: Equal access for all users.
No freeze or pause features: Always operational, no interruptions.
No administrative balance control: No interference with user holdings.
No proxy or upgrade system: Immutable code, no changes possible.
Because of these restrictions, neither the owner nor any third party can alter user balances or interfere with transfers. This ensures security and fairness, with the design promoting educational value through simplicity.

All behavior is permanently determined by the deployed code, verifiable on BscScan. To check: Use BscScan's read contract feature to test functions.
