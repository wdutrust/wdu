Social Channels & Public Reference Information

Introduction & Purpose


This page consolidates all publicly available reference information related to the WDU Trust Token (WDU) in one comprehensive location. We have expanded this document with detailed, clear explanations in simple language, ensuring full transparency about the project's identity, social channels, team members with professional profiles, and references. This helps reviewers and users verify everything independently.

The WDU Trust Token is a standard BEP-20 token on the BNB Smart Chain, fully compliant with BEP-20 specifications (including transfer, balance, approval functions). It is designed solely as an educational demonstration of basic token mechanics, with no financial, utility, or speculative features. This educational purpose means it exists to showcase smart contract deployment and transparency practices, without any intent for real-world use or value.

The purpose of this page is to clearly identify the project, define responsibility boundaries, disclose team members with verifiable professional profiles, and explain the role of public communication channels without creating any promotional, financial, or speculative interpretations. We break down each section step by step to address any concerns about clarity, anonymity, or misinformation, aligning with BscScan requirements.

This document is written specifically for public reviewers, blockchain explorers, and independent verification processes, including BscScan. All information is factual, verifiable on-chain or through public links, and does not distort or misrepresent any public entities or other projects. Everything is 100% original to this project.

Token Identification & On-Chain Reference
Here, we provide a complete, expanded overview of the token's on-chain details. Each item is explained simply and in detail: These are the core facts recorded directly on the blockchain, which anyone can verify using tools like BscScan. This ensures no ambiguity about what the token is, how it operates, or its limitations.

Token Name: WDU Trust Token – The full, unique name specifically chosen for this educational project, not imitating, copying, or misrepresenting any existing project, entity, or public institution.
Symbol: WDU – A simple, straightforward identifier for reference purposes only, without any implied value or association.
Standard: BEP-20 – The token fully complies with BEP-20 specifications, implementing all required functions (transfer, balanceOf, approve, allowance, totalSupply, transferFrom) without deviations or additional logic. This compliance is verifiable through the source code on BscScan.
Network: BNB Smart Chain – The public blockchain where the token resides, chosen for its efficiency in educational demonstrations.
Decimals: 18 – This defines the token's divisibility, a standard setting for BEP-20 tokens to ensure compatibility with wallets and tools.
Total Supply: 700,000,000,000,000 WDU (fixed at deployment) – All tokens were minted in a single transaction during deployment; no mechanisms exist for increases, decreases, minting, or burning, ensuring permanent immutability.
Smart Contract Address: 0x74D7d1aD19bD14655cD0Ab26BEcc57ED69d69413 – Direct link for verification, where users can inspect transactions, holders, and code.
Contract Verification: Verified on BscScan (2025-12-18) – The source code is publicly available and exactly matches the deployed contract, confirming no hidden features or risks.
Official Logo (SVG 32×32): View official file – A simple visual identifier for reference only, not for promotional use.
All parameters listed above are derived directly from the verified smart contract and can be independently confirmed through public blockchain explorers like BscScan. This on-chain data is the ultimate source of truth, immutable and transparent.

No off-chain source overrides, modifies, or supplements these on-chain facts. Everything is transparent, unchanged, and fully compliant with BEP-20 standards.

Smart Contract Characteristics & Limitations
The smart contract is designed for maximum simplicity, security, and transparency. We've expanded this section to explain each characteristic and limitation in detail, showing how it prevents any manipulation, financial features, or risks. This aligns with BscScan's emphasis on clear, verifiable disclosures.

No Minting or Burning: The contract has no functions to create new tokens or destroy existing ones. The supply is permanently fixed, eliminating any risk of inflation or deflation. This is verifiable in the source code.
No Ownership Privileges: There are no administrative functions allowing the owner to freeze accounts, pause transfers, or alter balances. The deployer has no ongoing control, ensuring decentralization and fairness.
No Taxes or Fees: Transfers incur no built-in taxes, fees, or deductions. Amounts are moved exactly as specified, with no hidden costs or redistributions.
No Blacklisting or Restrictions: All addresses can interact freely with the contract; there are no exclusion lists or restrictions, preventing any form of censorship or control.
No Upgradeability: The contract lacks proxy patterns or upgrade functions, making it permanently immutable and resistant to future changes.
Strict BEP-20 Compliance: Only standard BEP-20 functions are implemented, with no custom logic, ensuring compatibility and predictability.
These features collectively make the token a safe, transparent educational example. No economic mechanisms (e.g., staking, reflections, governance) exist or can be added, reinforcing its non-financial nature.
