Official Website & Domain Clarification


1. Purpose of This Page
This page is published to formally and explicitly identify the single official website domain associated with the WDU Trust Token (WDU) project. We have expanded this document with clear explanations to ensure full transparency about the token and project, addressing BscScan's requirements for clear information, team disclosure, and non-misrepresentation. To elaborate, this clarification helps users and reviewers distinguish the authentic source from any potential fakes, while providing exhaustive details on the project's structure and intent.

The WDU Trust Token is a standard BEP-20 token on the BNB Smart Chain, fully compliant with BEP-20 specifications (e.g., transfer, balance, approval functions, totalSupply, balanceOf, allowance, with event emissions for Transfer and Approval). It exists solely for educational purposes, with no financial features such as minting, burning, taxes, pauses, or upgrades. The token's total supply is fixed at 700,000,000,000,000 (700 trillion), minted only once at deployment, and is immutable – verifiable directly on BscScan. This page clarifies:

Official project web presence – The only authorized domain, used for educational content only.
Domain authenticity – Owned and controlled by the founder, with no external affiliations.
Responsibility boundaries – Non-financial scope only, focused on transparency and learning.
Protection against impersonation or misleading sources – Warnings on unauthorized sites, to prevent confusion.
This page is informational only and does not serve any promotional, financial, or transactional function. No investment claims or misrepresentations of public entities are made. All content is original and specific to this project, with no distortion from other sources.

2. Official Website Domain Declaration
The following domain is the only official website representing the WDU Trust Token (WDU) project:

https://www.wdu-trust.com

This domain is used exclusively to publish public-facing informational content, technical explanations, documentation, and transparency disclosures related to the token's BEP-20 structure and educational purpose. It hosts no interactive features, financial tools, user accounts, or e-commerce elements – purely static educational material. For example, it includes details on the token's compliance with BEP-20 interfaces, fixed supply mechanics, and on-chain verifiability, all accessible for learning.

No other domains, subdomains, mirrors, clones, or translations are authorized to represent the project. Any such sites should be considered unauthorized and potentially misleading.

3. Website Scope & Limitations
The official website is limited strictly to providing educational and transparency-focused content. It does **not**:

Host token sales, presales, airdrops, giveaways, or any fundraising mechanisms
Provide financial services, investment advice, trading tools, or wallet integrations
Offer user registration, accounts, dashboards, staking interfaces, or interactive features
Discuss price, market value, liquidity, exchange listings, or economic participation
Claim any affiliations, endorsements, or partnerships with external entities
The site serves as a static repository for project documentation, including whitepaper, team disclosures (with public professional profiles), cryptographic ownership proof, and BEP-20 technical details – all for educational reference only.

4. Domain Ownership & Control
The domain www.wdu-trust.com is registered, owned, and directly controlled by the project founder, woodi usimo. This includes full administrative access to hosting, DNS, content management, and updates – no third-party delegation or shared control exists.

Domain registration can be independently verified via public WHOIS tools, confirming the founder's ownership and the domain's legitimacy. No external registrars, hosting providers, or agencies have any influence or access rights.

5. Anti-Impersonation & Security Warning
Users should treat any domain or website not exactly matching www.wdu-trust.com as unauthorized and potentially fraudulent. Common impersonation tactics include:

Slightly altered domains (e.g., wdu-trust.net, wdu-trust.org, wdu-trust.io)
Subdomains or mirrors (e.g., wdu-trust.example.com)
Translated or localized clones (e.g., wdu-trust.cn)
Sites claiming affiliation but using different domains
Always verify the exact domain before interacting. Report suspicious sites to the official email for clarification.

6. Non-Financial & Compliance Statement
The website and project operate strictly within a non-financial, educational framework. No communication or content implies investment opportunities, profit expectations, or economic participation. This aligns with BscScan requirements for clear, non-misleading project information.

The token is a simple, fixed-supply (700 trillion), immutable BEP-20 with no mint/burn/tax logic – verifiable on BscScan. All disclosures are factual, consistent with on-chain data, and free from misrepresentation.
