WDU Trust Token (WDU) – Expanded Transparency Disclosure & Educational Project Information

1. Clear Project & Token Identification – Full Details
WDU Trust Token (symbol: WDU) is a standard BEP-20 token deployed on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC). The smart contract is immutable, fully verified on BscScan since December 18, 2025, and can be independently inspected by anyone at any time. This verification ensures the code matches the deployed bytecode, allowing public audits.

Contract Address: 0x74D7d1aD19bD14655cD0Ab26BEcc57ED69d69413

Key immutable parameters:

Total Supply: Exactly 700,000,000,000,000 WDU (700 trillion) – permanently fixed, no minting possible, verifiable via totalSupply()
Decimals: 18 – standard for token precision
No transaction taxes, fees, reflections, blacklists, pause functions, or upgradeable logic – pure BEP-20 compliance
The project is **fully independent** — no connection, affiliation, partnership, or endorsement exists with Binance, BNB Chain team, any exchange, launchpad, or third-party organization. All content is original and truthful, with no distortions from other projects.

Repeated for emphasis: This is strictly an **educational blockchain demonstration** — not a financial product, investment opportunity, or commercial platform. This clarity addresses BscScan requirements for accessible project information.

2. Explicit Project Purpose – Strictly Non-Financial & Educational
The **sole purpose** of WDU Trust is education, transparency, and serving as a public reference for blockchain learners and explorers:

Demonstrating real-world operation of a minimal, immutable BEP-20 token, with step-by-step on-chain examples
Enabling public verification of contract behavior and supply immutability, using BscScan tools
Providing a clean, simple example for understanding blockchain transparency and standards
Supporting blockchain explorer (e.g., BscScan) compliance and review processes, with detailed disclosures
There are **no** financial objectives:

No investment solicitation, profit promises, or returns implied, focusing purely on learning
No ICO/IDO/sale, staking, yield, rewards, or fundraising, excluding all economic features
No governance, DAO, or user voting mechanisms, maintaining simplicity
The token exists purely on-chain — users interact directly via their wallets with no project custody or dependency. This expanded purpose statement ensures no ambiguity.

3. Founder & Team Transparency – Full Public Accountability
To meet BscScan and explorer transparency standards, the founder and team are **fully disclosed** with **multiple verifiable public professional profiles** (standard in Web3 as equivalents to LinkedIn: X for visibility, Medium for articles, Instagram for outreach, Telegram for communication, Bitcointalk for discussions). This section provides expanded roles and responsibilities for clarity.
