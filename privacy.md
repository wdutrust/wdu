Privacy Policy & Full Project Transparency Declaration

1. Project Identity, Scope & Clear Definition – Repeated & Expanded for Maximum Clarity
WDU Trust Token (symbol: WDU) is a standard, immutable BEP-20 token deployed exclusively on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC). The contract address is 0x74D7d1aD19bD14655cD0Ab26BEcc57ED69d69413, with source code fully verified on BscScan since December 18, 2025. This verification ensures the code matches the deployed contract exactly, implementing all BEP-20 specifications (transfer, balanceOf, approve, etc.) without deviations, custom features, or additional logic.

This project exists solely as a decentralized digital token and a static informational website to document its technical structure, minimal design philosophy, immutability, and on-chain presence for educational purposes only. The token serves as a transparent example of blockchain basics, with no real-world utility or financial intent.

WDU Trust is explicitly NOT:

A registered company, foundation, DAO, or legal entity – It is an independent educational demonstration
A financial institution, investment platform, or service provider – No economic mechanisms or value promises
A fundraising mechanism, profit-sharing scheme, or yield-generating asset – No sales, staking, or rewards
A commercial product or utility with off-chain dependencies – Purely on-chain educational reference
No promises of profit, revenue, dividends, price appreciation, financial returns, or investment outcomes are made, implied, or suggested anywhere on this site, in documentation, or in related materials. The token is strictly educational — demonstrating how a simple, fixed-supply BEP-20 token operates predictably on a public blockchain, fully compliant with BEP-20 standards.

Key immutable facts (verifiable on BscScan):

Total Supply: Exactly 700,000,000,000,000 WDU (700 trillion) – permanently fixed, no minting, burning, or changes possible
Decimals: 18 – Standard for precision and compatibility
No taxes, fees, reflections, blacklists, pauses, or any restrictive functions – Pure BEP-20 transfers only
No upgradeable logic, proxies, or modifiable features – Contract is final and immutable forever
This section is deliberately repeated, expanded, and detailed to eliminate any possible ambiguity during BscScan or third-party compliance reviews regarding the project's nature, intent, boundaries, non-financial status, and full BEP-20 compliance. All content is 100% original and does not misrepresent or distort any public entities or other projects.

2. Founder, Team & Full Accountability Disclosure – Public Professional Profiles
WDU Trust is a founder-led, non-anonymous, independently managed educational project. Full responsibility lies with identifiable individuals — no hidden operators, DAOs, anonymous contributors, or third-party controllers. This disclosure meets BscScan requirements for clear, verifiable team information with professional profiles (equivalent to LinkedIn in blockchain: X, GitHub, Medium, etc.).

This section is expanded to clearly disclose all team members with direct links, ensuring no anonymity and full compliance with BscScan standards.

3. Independence, No Affiliations & Strict Non-Misrepresentation Declaration
WDU Trust is 100% independent — not affiliated, endorsed, sponsored, or connected to any third party.

Explicitly no affiliation with:

Binance, BNB Chain team, BscScan, or any Binance entity (uses public infrastructure factually, no endorsement)
Trust Wallet, MetaMask, or any wallet provider
Any exchange, DEX, bridge, or trading platform
Any government, regulator, institution, or organization
All content, names, symbols, terminology, and materials are 100% original — not copied, adapted, or derived from any public entity, other project, template, or institution. No misrepresentation, impersonation, or distortion of external information occurs.

This declaration is repeated and detailed to prevent any false assumptions during reviews.

4. Zero Data Collection Philosophy – Absolute Privacy by Design
WDU Trust follows a zero data philosophy: No user data is ever collected, stored, shared, sold, analyzed, or processed — period.

The website is designed as a purely static, read-only informational resource with no interactive elements that could collect data. This aligns with the project's educational, non-commercial nature and BscScan transparency focus.

5. Complete & Absolute Absence of Personal or Behavioral Data Collection
This website does not collect, request, store, process, infer, or analyze any personal or behavioral data whatsoever.

Explicitly not collected:

Names, emails, addresses, phone numbers, or any personal identifiers
IP addresses for profiling or tracking (only transient server logs if any, never stored or used)
Device/browser fingerprints, user agents, screen resolutions, or hardware details for tracking
Geolocation data, time zones, language preferences, or session metadata
Analytics metrics like visit counts, page views, time on site, bounce rates, heatmaps, or usage patterns
Wallet addresses, transaction histories, balances, or any blockchain-related personal data (all handled publicly on-chain)
No databases, user accounts, forms, sign-ups, newsletters, or interactive features exist that could enable data collection.

6. Zero Cookies, Zero Tracking, Zero Analytics
No cookies are set, used, or required for any purpose — no tracking cookies, no advertising cookies, no session cookies, no preference cookies.

No third-party scripts, tracking pixels, beacons, iframes, Google Analytics, Meta Pixel, Cloudflare analytics, or any monitoring/measurement services are loaded or embedded.

The site is served as pure static HTML/CSS — no JavaScript is required for core functionality, and there are no external dependencies that could enable tracking or data leakage.

7. Blockchain Interactions – Public & Independent
All token-related activity (transfers, balances, approvals) occurs directly on BNB Smart Chain via users' own wallets and tools (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet).

This website does not create, store, control, access, or process any blockchain data — it only provides factual links to public explorers like BscScan for independent verification.

Users interact peer-to-peer with the immutable contract — no intermediary services, no custody, no data collection by the project team.

8. Technical Architecture – Pure Static & Minimal
This is a 100% static informational website hosted on a simple server or CDN with no dynamic capabilities.

No backend servers, APIs, databases, user authentication systems, forms, or dynamic content generation exist that could enable data collection or processing.

No server-side logging of personal or identifiable data occurs — only standard HTTP access logs (if any) are transient, anonymized, and never used for profiling, analysis, or storage.

9. Purpose of This Document – BscScan Compliance & Transparency
This privacy & transparency declaration is published specifically to satisfy blockchain explorer requirements (especially BscScan) for:

Complete project clarity, non-financial intent, and BEP-20 compliance
Accurate, non-misleading, original disclosures with no misrepresentation
Clear responsibility/accountability via public team profiles and cryptographic proofs
Proof of absolute privacy respect and zero data collection practices
It eliminates uncertainty, prevents misinterpretation, and confirms the project as a transparent, educational, immutable BEP-20 demonstration — nothing more.
