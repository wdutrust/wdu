  <h3>1. Executive Summary</h3>
  <p>This document is provided primarily for transparency and blockchain explorer verification purposes.</p>
  <p>WDU Trust Token (WDU) is an independently maintained blockchain-based digital token developed under the BEP-20 standard on the BNB Smart Chain.</p>
  <p>The project is designed with a focus on transparency, verifiable smart contract behavior, and simplicity. WDU Trust does not represent an investment product and is not intended to generate financial returns.</p>
  <p>The smart contract was deployed with a fixed total supply. No minting, burning, taxation, or administrative control mechanisms exist within the contract.</p>

    <li>An investment reserve</li>
    <li>A treasury</li>
    <li>A fundraising pool</li>
    <li>A promise of future distribution</li>
    <li>A financial control mechanism</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The deployer wallet functions as a transparent on-chain holding address, fully visible and verifiable through BNB Smart Chain explorers.</p>
  <p>All token balances and movements (if any) remain publicly auditable and subject to independent verification.</p>

    <li>Mint additional tokens</li>
    <li>Restrict transfers</li>
    <li>Alter balances programmatically</li>
