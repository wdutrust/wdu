WDU Trust does not operate as a registered company, corporation,
foundation, or legal entity. As a result, no separate corporate
LinkedIn Page exists for the project.
</p>

<p>
The project is independently maintained by a publicly identifiable
individual who assumes full responsibility and ownership:

<strong>Founder & Project Owner:</strong><br>

</p>

<p>
This personal LinkedIn profile is public and maintained to reflect
direct involvement in the WDU Trust Token project as sole founder
and maintainer.
</p>

<p>
The profile serves as the primary professional identity reference
for accountability, ownership disclosure, and blockchain explorer
verification purposes.
</p>

<p>
This structure is intentionally disclosed to meet transparency
standards and to prevent impersonation or misleading representation.
