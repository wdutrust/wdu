  <h3>19. Token Holding & Deployment Wallet Disclosure</h3>
  <p>At the time of smart contract deployment, one hundred percent (100%) of the total WDU Trust Token supply was assigned to the deploying wallet.</p>
  <p>This wallet was used solely for contract deployment and initial token creation as defined by the BEP-20 standard.</p>
  <p>No token distribution, sale, transfer event, or allocation program was conducted at or after deployment.</p>
  <p>The presence of tokens in the deployer wallet does not represent:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An investment reserve</li>
    <li>A treasury</li>
    <li>A fundraising pool</li>
    <li>A promise of future distribution</li>
    <li>A financial control mechanism</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The deployer wallet functions as a transparent on-chain holding address, fully visible and verifiable through BNB Smart Chain explorers.</p>
  <p>All token balances and movements (if any) remain publicly auditable and subject to independent verification.</p>
</section>

<hr>

<section>
  <h3>20. Non-Custodial & No Control Statement</h3>
  <p>The WDU Trust Token smart contract does not grant the deployer or any address special privileges, administrative rights, or control mechanisms.</p>
  <p>Holding tokens in a wallet does not provide the ability to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Modify the contract</li>
    <li>Mint additional tokens</li>
    <li>Restrict transfers</li>
    <li>Alter balances programmatically</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Token ownership is governed solely by the immutable smart contract logic and standard BEP-20 transfer rules.</p>
</section>

<hr>

<section>
  <h3>21. Explorer Transparency Confirmation</h3>
  <p>The disclosure of token holding status is provided explicitly to meet blockchain explorer transparency and review requirements.</p>
