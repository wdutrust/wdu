Legal Disclaimer & Full Project Transparency Statement


Non-Financial • Strictly Educational • Transparency-Only Blockchain Demonstration

1. Project Nature & Clear Identity – Repeated for Clarity
WDU Trust Token (symbol: WDU) is a **fixed-supply, standard BEP-20 token** deployed on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC). Contract address: 0x74D7d1aD19bD14655cD0Ab26BEcc57ED69d69413 — source code **fully verified** on BscScan since December 18, 2025.

The project exists **solely** as an **educational and transparency-focused blockchain demonstration**. It is designed to show how a simple, immutable, minimal smart contract can operate predictably on a public network without hidden mechanics, taxes, minting, or financial features.

WDU Trust Token is **explicitly NOT**:

A financial instrument, investment opportunity, or security
A fundraising mechanism, profit-sharing scheme, or yield generator
A utility token with real-world use cases beyond demonstration
