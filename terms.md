Last Updated: January 24, 2026



1. Website & Project Purpose – Repeated & Expanded for Maximum Clarity
This entire website (including all pages, documents, whitepaper, team disclosure, roadmap, ownership verification, and any linked materials) is provided exclusively for informational, educational, technical reference, and transparency purposes only.

WDU Trust Token (WDU) is a decentralized, non-commercial, immutable, standard BEP-20 token deployed on BNB Smart Chain solely to serve as:

An educational demonstration of how a basic BEP-20 token is created, deployed, and verified on-chain
A public, verifiable example of fixed-supply, minimal smart contract design with full source code transparency
A transparent reference point for blockchain explorers (especially BscScan), developers, and learners studying token standards
A showcase of radical transparency practices, including full team identity disclosure with professional profiles and cryptographic proof of deployer ownership
WDU Trust is explicitly NOT and will never be:

A registered company, foundation, DAO, legal entity, or business organization
A financial institution, investment platform, security, regulated instrument, or DeFi product
A commercial product, service, utility token with real-world functionality, or ecosystem token
A fundraising vehicle, profit-oriented project, or speculative asset
No statement, text, graphic, document, social media post, email, or communication on this website or any official channel shall be interpreted as marketing, promotion, solicitation, invitation to invest, encouragement to acquire/hold/trade, or any form of financial advice.

This clarification is repeated and expanded multiple times across all site pages to eliminate any possible ambiguity during BscScan review, third-party compliance checks, or user interpretation. The project is 100% original, with no copying or distortion of names, concepts, or materials from public entities or other projects.

2. Strong Non-Financial Declaration – No Investment, No Fundraising, No Promises, No Misrepresentation
WDU Trust Token (WDU) is not a security, share, stock, bond, derivative, commodity, investment contract, Howey-test security, or any form of regulated financial instrument under any jurisdiction worldwide.

The project has never conducted, does not conduct, and will never conduct any of the following:

Initial Coin Offering (ICO), Initial Exchange Offering (IEO), Initial DEX Offering (IDO), or any token generation event
Public or private token sale, presale, whitelist, seed round, or community sale
Any type of fundraising, capital raising, donation drive, investment solicitation, or crowdfunding
Staking rewards, farming, liquidity mining, yield farming, airdrops, reflections, or any incentive/reward program
Profit-sharing, dividend distribution, revenue sharing, buyback, burn-and-mint schemes, or equity-like representation
Any claim of future utility, partnerships, exchange listings, or ecosystem development
No statement — whether in the whitepaper, roadmap, team page, ownership verification, social channels, or elsewhere — constitutes financial advice, investment recommendation, profit expectation, price prediction, value appreciation forecast, or any guarantee of returns.

Any external market valuation, price fluctuation, trading volume, liquidity provision, or perceived value of the token is entirely independent of the project team, its documentation, and its educational purpose.

This declaration is deliberately repeated, expanded, and emphasized to meet and exceed BscScan standards for non-misleading, clear, and original information.
